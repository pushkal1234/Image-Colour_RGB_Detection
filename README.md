# Image-Colour_RGB_Detection

Detection of colors RGB Value and object Identification from a mobile image and its implementation over the Android 
Application, extraction of colors from images is implemented using KMeans algorithm, OpenCV2 for image manipulation, 
and then plot the information using Matplotlib and deltaE_cie76 to calculate similarity between colors.
